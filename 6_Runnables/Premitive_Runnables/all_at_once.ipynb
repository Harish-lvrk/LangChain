      "{'joke': 'Here are a few jokes about the Indian education system, playing on different aspects:\\n\\n**Joke 1 (Focus on Rote Learning/Exams):**\\n\\n> Teacher: \"What is the capital of France?\"\\n>\\n> Student: \"The capital of France is the capital of France.\"\\n>\\n> Teacher: \"No, it\\'s Paris!\"\\n>\\n> Student: \"But you asked what the capital *of France* is, not what the capital *is*.\"\\n>\\n> Teacher: \"You\\'ll never pass your exams with that kind of logic!\"\\n>\\n> Student: \"But I\\'m studying for exams, not for a debate competition, sir!\"\\n\\n**Joke 2 (Focus on Parental Pressure/Engineering/Medical):**\\n\\n> A father is talking to his son:\\n>\\n> Father: \"Beta, you need to study hard. You must become either an engineer or a doctor!\"\\n>\\n> Son: \"But Papa, what if I want to be a writer?\"\\n>\\n> Father: \"Writer? That\\'s not a profession! That\\'s just a hobby for people who couldn\\'t get into engineering or medicine!\"\\n\\n**Joke 3 (Focus on the Vast Syllabus/Pressure):**\\n\\n> A student is drowning in the ocean. A boat comes by.\\n>\\n> Boatman: \"Hey! Do you need help?\"\\n>\\n> Student (gasping): \"Yes! Please, save me!\"\\n>\\n> Boatman: \"Okay, but first, tell me, have you finished reading the entire syllabus for History, Geography, Physics, Chemistry, and Maths yet?\"\\n>\\n> Student: \"What?! No!\"\\n>\\n> Boatman: \"Then you\\'re not drowning in a problem, you\\'re just facing a minor inconvenience. Keep swimming!\"\\n\\n**Joke 4 (Slightly more meta):**\\n\\n> Why did the Indian student bring a ladder to school?\\n>\\n> Because they heard the marks were going to be *really* high this year, and they wanted to reach them!\\n\\n**Joke 5 (Playing on the \"tuition\" culture):**\\n\\n> A child asks his mother, \"Mom, why do we have to go to school every day?\"\\n>\\n> Mother: \"So you can learn and get a good education, beta.\"\\n>\\n> Child: \"But we already go to tuition for every subject!\"\\n>\\n> Mother: \"Ah, that\\'s just the \\'practice session\\' for the real learning that happens at tuition!\"\\n\\nRemember, these are just for fun and to highlight common observations. The Indian education system is vast and complex, with many dedicated individuals working within it!', 'explanation': 'These jokes cleverly highlight some common observations and stereotypes associated with the Indian education system. Let\\'s break down the explanations for each:\\n\\n**Joke 1 (Focus on Rote Learning/Exams):**\\n\\n*   **The Humor:** This joke plays on the perceived emphasis on rote memorization and the rigid nature of exams in the Indian education system. The student\\'s logic is technically correct, but it\\'s the kind of literal interpretation that a teacher focused on exam performance would find frustrating. The punchline emphasizes that the student\\'s goal is to pass exams, not necessarily to engage in deeper, analytical thinking.\\n*   **Underlying Observation:** Many students in India feel pressured to memorize facts and figures to pass exams, rather than to truly understand concepts. Teachers, in turn, often feel compelled to \"teach to the test.\"\\n\\n**Joke 2 (Focus on Parental Pressure/Engineering/Medical):**\\n\\n*   **The Humor:** This joke satirizes the intense parental pressure on students to pursue careers in engineering or medicine, often at the expense of other, less \"prestigious\" fields. The father\\'s dismissive attitude towards writing as a profession, calling it a \"hobby for people who couldn\\'t get into engineering or medicine,\" is the core of the humor.\\n*   **Underlying Observation:** There\\'s a strong societal and parental bias in India towards engineering and medical fields, often seen as the most secure and respected career paths. This can lead to students feeling forced into these professions, even if their true passions lie elsewhere.\\n\\n**Joke 3 (Focus on the Vast Syllabus/Pressure):**\\n\\n*   **The Humor:** This joke uses hyperbole to illustrate the overwhelming nature of the Indian curriculum. The boatman\\'s absurd question about finishing the entire syllabus before offering help is meant to be ridiculous. The punchline, \"Then you\\'re not drowning in a problem, you\\'re just facing a minor inconvenience. Keep swimming!\", is a darkly humorous take on how students are expected to constantly battle an enormous amount of academic material.\\n*   **Underlying Observation:** The Indian syllabus, across many subjects, is often perceived as being incredibly extensive and demanding. Students often feel like they are constantly \"swimming\" through a vast sea of information, with little time for in-depth understanding or personal exploration.\\n\\n**Joke 4 (Slightly more meta):**\\n\\n*   **The Humor:** This is a playful and slightly self-deprecating joke. Bringing a ladder to school to reach \"really high marks\" is a visual metaphor for the aspirational, and often competitive, pursuit of high scores. The humor comes from the literal interpretation of a figurative concept.\\n*   **Underlying Observation:** The emphasis on scoring high marks in India is immense. Students and parents often strive for the highest possible grades, sometimes to the point where it feels like an almost unattainable goal.\\n\\n**Joke 5 (Playing on the \"tuition\" culture):**\\n\\n*   **The Humor:** This joke highlights the ubiquitous nature of private coaching classes, often referred to as \"tuition.\" The child\\'s innocent question reveals the redundancy of going to school for learning when tuition classes are perceived as the \"real\" place of education. The mother\\'s explanation that tuition is the \"practice session\" for the \"real learning\" at tuition is a satirical twist.\\n*   **Underlying Observation:** The \"tuition culture\" is a significant aspect of the Indian education landscape. Many students attend private coaching classes for almost every subject, often in addition to regular school, to gain an edge and cover the extensive syllabus. This can lead to a situation where school itself feels like a less important institution for actual learning.\\n\\n**Overall Message:**\\n\\nThese jokes, while humorous, point to genuine societal observations about the pressures, priorities, and perceived shortcomings within the Indian education system. They often touch upon:\\n\\n*   **The immense pressure to perform academically.**\\n*   **The focus on exams and marks over holistic learning.**\\n*   **The societal prestige attached to specific career paths.**\\n*   **The overwhelming nature of the syllabus.**\\n*   **The prevalence of private tuition.**\\n\\nIt\\'s important to remember, as the disclaimer states, that these are generalizations for comedic effect. The Indian education system is incredibly diverse and produces many brilliant minds. However, these jokes resonate because they tap into shared experiences and anxieties that many people have had within this system.'}\n"

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction / Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "**RunnableLambda** is a special Runnable in LangChain that lets you **wrap any normal Python function** (lambda or def) into the Runnable interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your own custom code can now behave exactly like an LLM, a PromptTemplate, or a Retriever.\n",
    "* It supports `.invoke()`, `.batch()`, `.stream()`, and can be composed with `|` just like other Runnables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Why it is Important\n",
    "\n",
    "‚Ä¢ In pipelines, not everything is an LLM or retriever. Sometimes you just need small steps like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* cleaning text\n",
    "* formatting data\n",
    "* adding numbers\n",
    "* custom business logic\n",
    "\n",
    "RunnableLambda gives a **bridge**: your Python code becomes a first-class Runnable, so you can insert it seamlessly into chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without it ‚Üí you‚Äôd need ‚Äúglue code‚Äù outside LangChain.\n",
    "With it ‚Üí everything fits into the same Runnable system.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. How it Works (intuitive explanation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a **conveyor belt of tasks** (runnables).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Normally, each station is a special machine (LLM, retriever, parser).\n",
    "* But sometimes, you just need a human with scissors to trim something simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "RunnableLambda = *that human station*.\n",
    "It takes an input, applies your Python function, and passes the result forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Code Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Simple Math Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wrap a Python function\n",
    "add_one = RunnableLambda(lambda x: x + 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(add_one.invoke(5))  # Output: 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "B) Composition with |\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "double = RunnableLambda(lambda x: x * 2)\n",
    "pipeline = add_one | double   # Equivalent to double(add_one(x))\n",
    "\n",
    "print(pipeline.invoke(3))  # (3+1)*2 = 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Batch Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(add_one.batch([1, 2, 3]))  \n",
    "# Output: [2, 3, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "D) Text Preprocessing in a Chain\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate\n",
    "\n",
    "# Function: lowercase text\n",
    "lowercase = RunnableLambda(lambda s: s.lower())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Combine with prompt\n",
    "prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(\"Summarize: {text}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "chain = lowercase | prompt\n",
    "print(chain.invoke(\"HELLO WORLD\"))  \n",
    "# \"Summarize: hello world\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Real-life Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of RunnableLambda like a **‚Äúcustom adapter‚Äù in a machine line**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can take any small helper (calculator, text cleaner, reformatter)\n",
    "* Plug it in so it behaves like any other official machine in the factory.\n",
    "\n",
    "It‚Äôs like hiring a freelancer who agrees to follow the company‚Äôs standard process ‚Äî so you don‚Äôt have to treat them differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Applications / Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "* Preprocessing (e.g., lowercase, strip punctuation, JSON cleaning)\n",
    "* Postprocessing (e.g., format LLM output into custom structure)\n",
    "* Data enrichment (e.g., add extra metadata before calling LLM)\n",
    "* Routing logic (e.g., decide which branch to send input to)\n",
    "* Quick testing (try ideas without writing a full custom Runnable class)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Advantages and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Very flexible ‚Äî any Python function can be integrated.\n",
    "* No need to subclass or write complex wrappers.\n",
    "* Plays nicely with batching, streaming, and composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the function is too heavy/slow, it doesn‚Äôt add scaling benefits by itself.\n",
    "* Unlike specialized Runnables (LLM, Retriever), you must ensure your function handles inputs/outputs correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Final Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "RunnableLambda = **the glue between LangChain and your custom Python code**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Wraps any function into the Runnable system.\n",
    "* Supports invoke, batch, stream, and composition.\n",
    "* Lets you seamlessly mix your own logic with LLMs, retrievers, prompts, and parsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as your **‚Äúcustom mini-tool‚Äù** inside a larger AI workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "Alright Stark, let‚Äôs go step by step and build a **clear, intuitive explanation of LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction / Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "**LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)** is a **declarative way to build chains/pipelines** in LangChain using a simple syntax (like pipes `|`, dicts `{}`, and functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of writing long custom classes or glue code, you express workflows **directly in code like math expressions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example intuition:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Math: `y = (x + 1) * 2`\n",
    "* LCEL: `result = retriever | prompt | llm | parser`\n",
    "\n",
    "So LCEL is **not a separate language** ‚Äì it‚Äôs just a clean, expressive API built on top of Python for composing **Runnables**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Why It Is Important\n",
    "\n",
    "Before LCEL:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You had to use **Chains** (like `LLMChain`, `SimpleSequentialChain`, etc.).\n",
    "* Each chain type had its own constructor, and mixing them was messy.\n",
    "* Adding parallel, conditional, or batch processing required extra boilerplate.\n",
    "\n",
    "With LCEL:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every component is a Runnable.\n",
    "* You can connect them easily with pipes, dicts, or branches.\n",
    "* It‚Äôs **declarative** ‚Üí you describe what you want, not how to glue it together.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. How It Works (Intuitive Explanation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of LCEL as **Lego blocks**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each block = a Runnable (LLM, Prompt, Parser, Retriever, Lambda, etc.).\n",
    "* The `|` operator = ‚Äúsnap blocks in a line‚Äù (sequence).\n",
    "* A dict `{ \"a\": block1, \"b\": block2 }` = ‚Äúrun blocks in parallel‚Äù and collect results.\n",
    "* A branch = ‚Äúif/else logic‚Äù for choosing paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "So LCEL lets you **draw pipelines directly in code**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Types of Composition in LCEL\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sequential (| operator)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Connects components in a straight line.\n",
    "   * Example: `retriever | prompt | llm | parser`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parallel (dict)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Run multiple components at once on the same input.\n",
    "   * Example: `{ \"summary\": summarizer, \"keywords\": keyword_extractor }`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Branching (RunnableBranch)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Route inputs conditionally.\n",
    "   * Example: `RunnableBranch([(is_question, qa_chain)], default=chat_chain)`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Code Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Simple Sequential Chain\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate\n",
    "from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n",
    "from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser\n",
    "\n",
    "prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(\"Tell me a joke about {topic}\")\n",
    "llm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\")\n",
    "parser = StrOutputParser()\n",
    "\n",
    "chain = prompt | llm | parser\n",
    "\n",
    "print(chain.invoke({\"topic\": \"cats\"}))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "B) Parallel Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableParallel, RunnableLambda\n",
    "\n",
    "chain = RunnableParallel({\n",
    "    \"original\": RunnableLambda(lambda x: x),\n",
    "    \"length\": RunnableLambda(lambda x: len(x)),\n",
    "})\n",
    "\n",
    "print(chain.invoke(\"LangChain is cool\"))\n",
    "# Output: {\"original\": \"LangChain is cool\", \"length\": 17}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Branch Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableBranch, RunnableLambda\n",
    "\n",
    "is_question = lambda x: x.endswith(\"?\")\n",
    "qa = RunnableLambda(lambda x: f\"Answering the question: {x}\")\n",
    "chat = RunnableLambda(lambda x: f\"Chatting: {x}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "branch = RunnableBranch(\n",
    "    (is_question, qa),\n",
    "    chat  # default\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(branch.invoke(\"How are you?\"))   # Answering the question: How are you?\n",
    "print(branch.invoke(\"Nice weather today\"))  # Chatting: Nice weather today\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Real-life Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of LCEL like **drawing a flowchart with code**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `|` = arrows connecting boxes.\n",
    "* Dict `{}` = splitting into multiple branches that run in parallel.\n",
    "* Branch = decision diamond (‚Äúyes ‚Üí this path, no ‚Üí that path‚Äù).\n",
    "\n",
    "So instead of coding the wiring, you just **sketch your workflow in expressions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Applications / Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RAG Pipelines**: `retriever | prompt | llm | parser`\n",
    "* **Multi-output generation**: `{ \"summary\": summarizer, \"keywords\": keyword_extractor }`\n",
    "* **Conditional Routing**: send input to different LLMs or retrievers based on conditions.\n",
    "* **Preprocessing + Postprocessing**: `lambda_cleaner | llm | parser`\n",
    "* **Batch/Streaming friendly workflows**: everything supports `.batch()` and `.stream()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Advantages and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Declarative and intuitive syntax.\n",
    "* Works with all Runnables uniformly.\n",
    "* Supports sync, async, batch, and streaming without extra code.\n",
    "* Easy to visualize pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Debugging large, complex graphs can still be tricky.\n",
    "* Requires you to understand input/output shapes carefully (dict vs str vs list).\n",
    "* Some advanced features (like retry/fallbacks) need extra wrappers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Final Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* **LCEL = LangChain Expression Language**, a **declarative syntax for building pipelines**.\n",
    "* Uses `|` for sequences, dicts `{}` for parallel, and branches for conditionals.\n",
    "* Intuition: Lego blocks (Runnables) + arrows (`|`) = flowchart in code.\n",
    "* Benefits: cleaner, composable, production-ready pipelines with less boilerplate.\n",
    "* Real power: you can express **complex workflows** (retrieval, routing, enrichment, parsing) with just a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to also **draw a flowchart diagram** (using text or ASCII art) to visually show how LCEL pipelines map to graphs? That could make it super clear.\n"
